# Real-Time Emotion Recognition Using DeepFace

## Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time emotion recognition system combining Haar Cascades for face detection and the DeepFace library for emotion analysis. The system was designed with cross-cultural applicability in mind and uses open-source tools to classify emotions from webcam input.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (Haar Cascades)
- DeepFace

## Features
- Real-time webcam-based emotion recognition
- Fast face detection using Haar Cascades
- Emotion classification using pre-trained DeepFace models
- Cross-cultural considerations
- Comparison of feature-based vs. deep learning-based vision techniques
