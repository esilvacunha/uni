# Semantic Segmentation for Face/Head Recognition

**Module:** Bilderkennung 1  
**Technologies:** Python, Deep Learning, Semantic Segmentation, DeepLabV3, PSPNet

## Project Overview

This project focused on developing and evaluating semantic segmentation models to enhance facial feature recognition across diverse ethnic backgrounds. Using DeepLabV3 and PSPNet architectures, models were trained on the Mut1ny dataset — a large, diverse face/head segmentation dataset with over 16,500 labeled images from various ethnicities, ages, and genders.

The trained models were tested on custom images representing Asian, Black, and Caucasian individuals. Performance was assessed using metrics such as F1 score, recall, precision, accuracy, and Intersection over Union (IoU).

## Key Highlights

- Implementation and training of **DeepLabV3** and **PSPNet** models.
- Evaluation on a culturally diverse face/head dataset (Mut1ny).
- Analysis of model performance across different ethnic groups.
- Focus on improving fairness and accuracy in facial recognition.
